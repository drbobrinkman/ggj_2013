A game about the first time I saw my baby, and heard her soothing heartbeat.

Installation
------------
This game requires an Atari VCS (Atari 2600) or emulator to play. I recommend downloading the Stella emulator, from http://stella.sourceforge.net

The game should also be playable on Atari hardware via the Harmony Cartridge, http://harmony.atariage.com/

How to Play
-----------
1-Player, play with the Atari Joystick controller

Your goal is the listen to the heartbeat of your un-born baby for as long as possible. You control an ultrasound probe (blue square) using the joystick.

The baby (pink square) is initially hidden, until you can find her with the probe. Move around and listen to the heartbeat to track her down.

She was very squirmy, and wouldn't lie still to have her heartbeat checked. As she moves, keep moving the probe to stay near her. The goal is to "lock on" to the heartbeat, which will be indicated by waves on the screen.

Follow the baby, and stay locked on as long as possible. Once you lock on, the game will end the next time you lose track of the baby.

Score is indicated by the colored bar at the top of the screen, which counts how many total seconds you have listened to the baby's heart. Each time you complete a minute, the bar resets and changes color.
